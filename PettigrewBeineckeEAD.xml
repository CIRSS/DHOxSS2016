            of correspondents, including scholars and antiquarians, members of the nobility and
            gentry, and professional colleagues. The letters concern scientific matters, including
            Egyptology and medicine, and the affairs of the various learned societies of which
            Pettigrew was a member, such as the British Archaeological Association, the Medical
            Society of London, the Royal Society, the Society of Antiquarians, and the Archaeologcal

         <head>THOMAS JOSEPH PETTIGREW, 1791-1865 </head>
         <p>Thomas Joseph Pettigrew, second son of the surgeon-apothecary William Pettigrew, was born in
    London on October 28th, 1791. After serving his apprenticeship under the surgeon John Taunton,
    he was elected secretary of the Medical Society of London in 1812, became secretary to the Royal
    Humane Society in the following year, and was subsequently appointed surgeon to the Duke of Kent </p>
         <p>Pettigrew was appointed surgeon and librarian to the Duke of Sussex in 1819, and in the
    following two decades successfully pursued a dual career as surgeon and as antiquary. He became
    surgeon to the Asylum for Female Orphans and to the Charing Cross Hospital, and he was elected
    fellow of the Royal Society. In his role as librarian, Pettigrew planned an ambitious catalogue
    of the Duke of Sussex&apos;s collection, the first volume of which was published in 1827 as
     <title render="italic" xlink:type="simple">Bibliotheca Sussexiana</title>. </p>
         <p>During the 1830s, however, Pettigrew faced difficulties in both of his chosen fields. The Duke
    of Sussex, embarrassed by Pettigrew&apos;s tendencies to gossip and by his mismanagement of the
    Duke&apos;s 1830 election as President of the Royal Society, dismissed him from his posts. In 1835,
    Pettigrew resigned from Charing Cross Hospital in the wake of accusations that he had accepted
    fees from candidates for assistant surgeons&apos; appointments. </p>
         <p>Although he published a spirited defense of his conduct, Pettigrew withdrew to private medical
    practice and devoted increasing time to his antiquarian interests. He published <title render="italic" xlink:type="simple">A History
     of Egyptian Mummies</title> in 1834 and the first part of his planned <title render="italic" xlink:type="simple">Encyclopaedia
     Aegyptiana</title> (never completed) in 1842. While Sussex refused to reinstate him as his
    librarian, he did allow Pettigrew to complete and publish the second volume of of his planned
     <title render="italic" xlink:type="simple">Bibliotheca Sussexiana</title> in 1834. Pettigrew&apos;s four volume <title render="italic" xlink:type="simple">Medical Portrait
     Gallery</title>, which included his own biographical sketch, appeared in 1839. </p>
         <p>In 1843 Pettgrew was elected as fellow to the Royal College of Surgeons, and in the same year
    became one of the founding members of the British Archaeological Association, serving as its
    treasurer for the rest of his life. He was also active in the Percy Society, the Historical
    Society of Science, and the Society of Antiquaries, and authored many antiquarian articles for
    the <title render="italic" xlink:type="simple">Journal of the British Archaeological Association</title> and
    <title render="italic" xlink:type="simple">Archaeologica</title>. </p>
         <p>During the early 1850s Pettigrew again engaged in controversies, publishing an attack on the
    management of the Society of Antiquaries in 1852 (<title render="italic" xlink:type="simple">Letter to the Lord Viscount
    Mahon</title>) and defending his own management of the British Archaelogical Association from an
    attack by Richard Hugo in 1854. In that year his wife died, and Pettigrew retired from medical
    practice entirely. He published <title render="italic" xlink:type="simple">Chronicles of the Tombs</title> in 1857. Thomas Pettigrew
    died at home in Brompton on November 23, 1865. His library was sold at Sotheby&apos;s seven months
    later. </p>

         <head>Description of the Papers</head>
         <p>The Pettigrew Papers consist almost entirely of letters received by Thomas Pettigrew. The
    papers span the dates 1791-1865 and are organized into two series: <title render="italic" xlink:type="simple">General Correspondence
     Files</title> and 
     <title render="italic" xlink:type="simple">Additional Correspondence.</title>
         </p>
         <p>
            <ref target="SI" xlink:actuate="onRequest" xlink:show="replace" xlink:type="simple">Series I, <title render="italic" xlink:type="simple">General Correspondence Files</title>
            </ref>, is housed in
    Boxes 1-13 and is arranged alphabetically by author. Detailed folder notes in the box and folder
    list highlight the main topics of most correspondents&apos; letters. In general, the bulk of the
    correspondences deals with routine business matters of the British Archaeological Association,
    and includes responses to requests for donations and support; nominations to various offices;
    meeting and tour arrangements; papers and publications by members; and the general antiquarian
    interests of the correspondents. There is also considerable discussion of the competition
    between the B.A.A. and other antiquarian organizations, particularly the Archaeological
    Institute and the Society of Antiquaries, as well as commentary on the internal politics of all
    of the associations. </p>
         <p>Pettigrew&apos;s tireless promotion of the British Archaeological Association is perhaps best
    illustrated by his extensive correspondence with members of the nobility and gentry whose
    patronage he solicited. His results were mixed. For example, the Marquess of Camden declined the
    Presidency, but accepted a largely ceremonial Vice-Presidency; several nobles, including the
    Dukes of Devonshire and Grafton and the Earl of Ferrers, declined the Vice-Presidencies as well.
    Baron Berwick agreed to be listed as a patron provided that he would not be asked to &quot;perform
    any active part in matters which I do not at all understand,&quot; while Baron Stanley accepted a
    Vice-Presidency on the condition that he would not be required to attend meetings. Many
    correspondents declined altogether. On the other hand, Baron Londesborough&apos;s letters discuss his
    work for the organization in great detail (Box 7, folders 346-347) </p>
         <p>Nevertheless, several noble correspondents became active members of the BAA: the letters of
    the Earl of Darnley (Box 4, folder 162) and of the Earl of Arundell (Box 1, folder 21) document
    visits by the society to their estates, while those of the Earl of Harrowby describe an
    antiquarian article intended for the BAA&apos;s quarterly periodical. Baron Londesborough&apos;s many
    letters discuss his work for the organization in great detail (Box 7, folders 346-347). </p>
         <p>Box 21 contains a few personal papers, including a photograph of Pettigrew and a prospectus
    for the restoration of Shakespeare&apos;s tomb.</p>
