My dear <PERSON>Pettigrew</PERSON>,
On coming here, I have found your kind Note with its printed inclosure.  I thank you for both, but I should have been glad to have found you here in person.  I cannot call on you today, but I am desirous to assure you that I fully agree with our friend <PERSON>Mr Henry Ellis</PERSON>, that he & I ought not to mix ourselves up with either of the belligerent parties.  I am constitutionally a man of peace, and if I could assist in restoring that blessing, I would carry an olive branch to each of the <ORGANIZATION>Rival Camps</ORGANIZATION>, if I did not fear I should be drummed out of both.  I have great respect for <PERSON>Lord Albert Conyngham</PERSON>, and for many of your colleagues, as I also have for many of the staff on the other side.  I certainly shall not join them, but I am desirous that my name should be withdrawn from your committee, highly respectable, as it is, in its composition.  I sincerely hope that archaeological ??? will not interfere with the comforts of our antiquarian club, where I trust the word "archaeology" will not be even whispered.  "Oh no, we never mention it!", shall at least be my motto there.
With the kindest regard, 
I remain always,

I shall not be able to prepare a Reading, nor probably be able to be in <LOCATION>Canterbury</LOCATION> more than one day, or two days at most.  Since there are others, <PERSON>Mr James</PERSON> for instance, who would better fill up the printer's blank with literary & historical name.  My [...] at <ORGANIZATION>Somerset House</ORGANIZATION> alone gives one anything like a pretence for accepting the elevation you propose.  I presume my learned colleague will prepare a <ARTIFACT>paper on the Battle of Bosworth</ARTIFACT>.

I have had a severe and unremitting diarrhea upon me ever since I returned, which commenced at <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> and remained until yesterday, which has greatly reduced me and rendered me very weak, and I much fear will prevent my being at <LOCATION>Gloucester</LOCATION> on Monday as I most anxiously wished to be.

What this saying means is a good subject for an Archaeological Paper - does it infer that he takes no notice of that famous city?  That he overlooks it?  That he oversees with particular care?  That he hovers over it?  That he does not look into it?  Many other questions of the same order and category may be propounded, which able antiquaries may discuss if not puzzle themselves and the world with.  For my part I think his majesty looks into most large cities and smiles with ineffable delight on what he sees in them.  There can be no doubt but he was delighted at <LOCATION>Gloucester</LOCATION> when the glorious Protestant martyrs were burned there and will probably be present next week to say something in favour of medieval or primeval antiquities.  He is now at <LOCATION>York</LOCATION> but the <ORGANIZATION>Rail Roads</ORGANIZATION> will transport him with delight in a very short period of time if he require such assistance.  No doubt he prevented <PERSON>Mr Way</PERSON> from attending at <LOCATION>York</LOCATION> and was devilish glad to accomplish so great an object.  The ominous absence of the <PERSON>Secretary of the <ORGANIZATION>Institute</ORGANIZATION></PERSON> suggests the idea of a new split, is he contriving a new society?  What will he call it?

Your note takes me, after what I forwarded to you, quite by surprise: because from the letter I received I had formed a notion that <PERSON>Mr. Gilbert</PERSON> did not intend to resign the Presidency voluntarily: and you say "he has sent me his resignation in favor of the <PERSON>Duke of Sussex</PERSON> and <PERSON>H.R.H.</PERSON> has accepted of the nomination"

<PERSON>Dear Pettigrew</PERSON>,
I have waited hitherto in the anxious expectation of getting for you a <ORGANIZATION>Hereford Times</ORGANIZATION> paper, in which my inaugural address appeared.  But no premium on the original cost can procure one, as the whole impression (though enlarged on the occasion) was swept away at once.  King of the <ORGANIZATION>Herald's College</ORGANIZATION> has a copy that he would shew you, if you can contrive it, but the honor you intend me is not worth putting you to trouble to perform, though I am quite sensible of my obligation.  
The first lecture on the Histy. of <LOCATION>England</LOCATION> was to have appeared to day, but instead there is a postponement of a first portion to next Saturday.  If they send me from <ORGANIZATION>Hereford</ORGANIZATION> the number I have ordered, I shall have the pleasure of forwarding one to you.  But please read it as address to mechanics who have all to learn.
King will bring down the sword on the 5th of August, and what you sent with it I am expecting with a large package of books by the waggon.  
I trust your daughter was quite well when you heard from her and that if she and her husband ever feel inclined to travel towards this part of the world I shall be most happy to receive then as <ORGANIZATION>Goodrich Court</ORGANIZATION>.
With best respts. to <PERSON>Mrs Pettigrew</PERSON> and the rest of your family 
I remain

Dear <PERSON>Pettigrew</PERSON>
I am very greatly obliged by the trouble you have been taking about the catalogues, and trust sooner or later your exertions will be crowned with success.  I fear your kindness induces you to speak too well of what I addressed to the mechanics, but it must always be borne in mind, that I had to speak to people but little informed.  This post ought to have conveyed to you a portion of my 2nd lecture but the editor of the <ORGANIZATION>Hereford Times</ORGANIZATION> has not sent me the right number.  I have however written to him, and as soon as I get it, will forward your copy.  Many thanks for your kind intention respecting the Medical Superstitions.  The book cannot fail to be interesting, if as well compsosed as your other works.  
I regret to hear of Mr <PERSON>Gurney</PERSON>'s bad state of health, but as I know he is in good hands, am sure that all which science and skill can effect, he will have the good fortune to experience.  
Not unnecessarily to intrude, I shall beg to be remembered to the different branches of your family when you write to them, and to subscribe myself
Most truly yours

My dear <PERSON>Pettigrew</PERSON>
The only reason I did not transmit to you my approval of your reply was an idea that it would be surplusage, as every unprejudiced person must have regarded it as quite satisfactory.  I am delighted with the sentence p.g. beginning "It may be safe," but what most astonishes me is your praiseworthy conduct in being so temperate while so much is done to stimulate your anger.
I cannot be present at <LOCATION>Winchester</LOCATION>.  If I could for one day, I would for all.  The lecture on shipbuilding thought calculated for a <ORGANIZATION>Mechanics Institute</ORGANIZATION> would requite not only to be greatly simplified, but treated more scientifically when read to so learned a body as the <ORGANIZATION>British Archaeological Society</ORGANIZATION>.  For this I have not the time.  The Hon. G. Secretary of the <ORGANIZATION>Archaeological Society</ORGANIZATION> asked me last year to dress up the paper I sent to the Antiquaries, on alphabetical notation in music, for your last meeting at <ORGANIZATION>Canterbury</ORGANIZATION>.  
Had the Dean of <LOCATION>Hereford</LOCATION> kept his promise (a practice I never find him pursue) and given me tracings from a flyleaf to a book in the Cathedral library, I think with other memoranda, a curious dissertation might be written on that subject, but for all the renewed promises on this matter I have waited in vain.  
Wishing you every success, and still hoping that the severed parts of the <ORGANIZATION>Association</ORGANIZATION> may be reunited, 
I remain, my dear friend,

Enclosed is the silver, and tomorrow I will send the gold of my young cousin's subscription to the Archl. Association, and when received you can send the receipt to him.  I shall also send you <PERSON>Shaw</PERSON>'s tracing & King's colouring of the painted slab you wished with a pencil tracing of the figure by the note to shew with how much more spirit and how far more artistically the original is.  There will be with it the ground plans and elevations of the ship temples, to which your artist must give effect and which must be numbered with corresponding references in the letter-press.  If I have time to make a reduced drawing of the Roman inscribed monumental stone with its specimen of military costume I will do so, as Mr. <PERSON>Roach Smith</PERSON> desired, if not the others must go without.  
If you publish a volume on your <LOCATION>Gloucester</LOCATION> peregrination, please to put my name down for a copy.

My object in speaking to Mr <PERSON>Wright</PERSON> was to know whether my paper on the <LOCATION>Llanvair</LOCATION> rail which I had written to demonstrate its being alphabetic musical notation, was to be published in the account of the <ORGANIZATION>Gloucester Congress</ORGANIZATION>.  He said that he could not answer the question till there had been a meeting to determine the matter and that he would speak to you o the subject.  You will very greatly oblige me by the earliest information thereon, as should it be rejected, I must beg to have the paper and drawings returned as soon after as possible, because I should then read it at the congress of the <ORGANIZATION>Cambrian Archaeological Institute at Aberystwyth</ORGANIZATION> in the second week in September.  I would much rather both my communications appeared with your <ORGANIZATION>Association</ORGANIZATION>, but if that be inconvenient, I must send an early notice to the Cambrian secretary.  The country is looking most beautiful and I found quiet and dose of castor oil restore me to perfect health, which for wont of both I could not have in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>.

Dear Sir,
I shall only say in answer to what you observe on the invention of my name, that you will see from the enclosed my wish that it shod remains set down for five copies.  On the subject of <PERSON>Walter Scott</PERSON> I think that he has considerable genius too much alloyed by taste; but I have never seen either genius or taste in the criticisms on poetry I have read in the <ORGANIZATION>Edinburgh Review</ORGANIZATION>; which seems quite at variance with <LOCATION>Longinus</LOCATION> on the pleasure derived from antientry (?).  They seem to wish the distinction of received opinions on poetry, without substituting new ones, or even explaining what they would have.  I congratulate you on the idea of <ORGANIZATION>Westminster Abbey</ORGANIZATION> as a subject of local poetry, & wonder I never thought of it, in reading Spectator, or <PERSON>Walker</PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION>St James</ORGANIZATION>'s Park.  It is one indeed replete with sublimity; of which your plan, too, allows the full operation.  I did not think I should have had to quote in answer to you, as <LOCATION>West</LOCATION> did in answer to <PERSON>Gray</PERSON> "vive paulisper cum vivis" for I have lately upbraided a really old bard, <PERSON>Jerningham</PERSON>, for writing his Farewell, when he presented it to me.  I hope you will be the poet, if there is to be one, who will celebrate Stoke; as Dr <PERSON>Lyther</PERSON> who was meditating it, is dead, & cannot therefore prevent it from sharing his fate.  In the mean time, I trust we shall drink to the memory of <ORGANIZATION>Horace & Maecenas</ORGANIZATION>, writers of the old school, when their busts adorn my garden, opposite to each other, & breathe a wish for the restoration of pure taste, on perusing the immortal alcaics beneath them.

Six wood cuts of coins and one plate will be required, the former will be from about 36s to two pounds as near as I can judge  The plate I will have engraved at my own expense.  The paper will occupy 14 or 15 pages of the <ORGANIZATION>Journal</ORGANIZATION>

With regard to the subject on which we spoke the other evening I fear I did not sufficiently let you understand, how matters at present are - although nothing at present is definitely settled, yet a certain partie has already been spoke to on the subject, but who unfortunately has never had the advantage of seeing the country - but at the same time I am strongly inclined to think would forgo any claim he may have, were there a probability of Sir <PERSON>G.W.</PERSON> being likely to devote his talents and reputation to such an understanding - but whose own reputation stands sufficiently high both in literature and arts - as to be quite equal to the work.

In consequence of your intimation that I might give the ticket you were so good as to forward me to a friend in spite of the "not transferable" on its face, I have sent it to the Revd. Geo. <PERSON>Wallace</PERSON>, headmaster of the <ORGANIZATION>King's School</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Canterbury</LOCATION>.  I have been unequal to my previous exertions ever since my last visit to <LOCATION>East Kent</LOCATION>, on my way thither, at Mr <PERSON>Darrell</PERSON>'s at <LOCATION>Calehill</LOCATION>, I had a violent attack of Cholera, and was forced to spare myself when under other hospitable roofs.  I continued to exert myself, however until on 9th June 1843, when I had a paralytic stroke, & since when, good spirits are almost the only sign of my former self remaining.  Whilst I live, however, I shall take an interest in antiquarian researches, and be happy if my stores can be made useful to others.  They are ample, in the medieval period of our County History.  
My friend <PERSON>Lambert Larking</PERSON> will probably be pleased with an opportunity of referring to a letter, in the Chapter Library, from a vicar written to a Prior of Xtr Chh. of which I made an imperfect copy, upon which we tried our skill together.
He has himself no common skill in decyphering old writing, but if a fee will obtain more competent assistance, beg him to advance it on my account.  I presume the association have secured access to the Chapter Library.  It was kindly accorded to myself by Dr Spry.
On the Eastern side of the cloisters is a figure, commonly pointed out as Prior Chillenden.  There is a legend round it, of which sufficient remains legible to show it to be "<PERSON>Frater John</PERSON> "Schepuys(?)".  
On the south side of the cloisters, the tale of the fox (or wolf) and the geese, is given on a succession of bosses, on the last of which, the cloister has vented its satire and I think it is worth observing, though it might escape if you were not awake to it.
I had occasion to fall so foul of Mr <PERSON>Willement</PERSON>, that several of my friends have expressed their regret, but I must call attention to other instances of his misrepresentation, that I have not already brought forward, that will justify me.  His No. 737, which he calls a lyon salient on a throne, will be seen to be a lyon breaking out of a cage; and his Number 242, & 259, to be very incorrectly blazoned.  But my pen and my hand fail me, and it is well, as few attach the importance to heraldry that I do.  
Respectfully,
Though with a weary hand,

My dear Sir, 
Agreeably to my promise I send you an extract from <ORGANIZATION>Plato</ORGANIZATION> respecting the burial of the dead.  The extract is from the 12th book of his Laws, but is not an Egyptian law, but one of his own.  So that the Frenchman who quoted it as an Egyptian custom, did so in perfect conformity to the slapdash & harum-scarum manner of the sublime genius of the moderns.

Dear Sir,
You will be quite welcome to the use of the engraving of the Jewry Wall.  The plan was lithographed for me in this town from a draught prepared by Mr Wickes.  I believe the stone has been altered since my copies were taken from it: therefore, if you require other for the journal, the plan will require lithographing afresh.  You would be better able to get the plan done in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> than it could be executed here, and cheaper too.
The excavations to which I refer in the paper have recently been ??tended a little, & are found [...] reveal a quantity of roman masonry, immensely thick and of almost inseparable tenacity.

<PERSON>Gavelle</PERSON> and I have much pleasure in accepting your friendly invitation for Friday at ? past 6.
In such a case as Mr <PERSON>Isaacson</PERSON>, [my Co] my editorial duties must be merely to see the MS through the press: I may not add, nor take away.  What I should propose is, that each author condense his own paper: for it is an awkward matter to shorten the noses of other people's children.  The 3 papers you have confided to me number 50 sides of MS: the quantity of type that will occupy depends upon the style of writing: I should say about 40 pages: if so, they are scarcely more than may fairly be set up verbatim.  
All prosperities to you & yours.  If ever you want to see me about the Volume, or anything else, I will if you send me times, call on you when in your morning gown.  Our kind regards to Mrs Pettigrew & you ??? & I am,

I should have great pleasure in complying with your request if it were in my power - but I have nothing by me relating to the subject you mention - and I am too old to write any thing new - Roman roads are subjects for young and active men who can walk over a county - and carefully trace the ancient ways, now nearly obliterated by the hand of the husbandman.
The programme - for a copy of which I am much obliged to you - promises an interesting meeting of the <ORGANIZATION>Association</ORGANIZATION>.

Nov. 17. 1836
Dear Sir,
I received your note yesterday, and in reply beg to send a printed copy of the little essay on the kind of which you make such use as may be convenient.  It purports to have been printed along with the Met. Literary Journal, but such was not the case on account of a delay at the printers and there are not ten copies of it circulating - these being among friends in the North of <LOCATION>England</LOCATION>.  I am not surprised at the difficulty in establishing a <ORGANIZATION>Medical Journal</ORGANIZATION>, and it was from a knowledge of such difficulty that I ventured to propose the propriety of the medical profession in the various provincial towns being canvassed in the way of business, so that a valuable property might in a few weeks be made of it, when as under other circumstances, it too often happens that great costs are incurred.  I have not seen the work advertised - if you wish it & will send it, I think I could take upon my to say that I would have the prospectus in the Conser. Journal, at one third the price.  We circulate several thousands.  
I am sorry to say I have not by me the cowardly and abject apology of the Rev. <PERSON>Mr Worthington</PERSON>.  I do not know that there one person living whom I more thoroughly despise than this man.  I consider him a mean and dastardly calumniator, and totally worthless as an individual.  His public conduct is everywhere offensive, and I noticed him figuring very discreditably the other day at the <LOCATION>Mansion House</LOCATION>, when he was called to order by the Lord Mayor.  His officiousness in joining the <ORGANIZATION>Committee</ORGANIZATION> of a public newspaper is extremely reprehensible, and I am not sure that both his conduct and that of another clergyman on the same committee ought not to be laid before the Bishop of the Diocese.  I have read the joint stock reply, which the <ORGANIZATION>Charing Cross</ORGANIZATION> people have made to your charges.  It is really as a composition below contempt, and I find that the refutations are chiefly supported by one another.  The testimonials of Dr this & Dr that is really too absurd - and only worthy of the invention of <ORGANIZATION>Patent Medicines</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Rowlands</PERSON>' Macassar, or <PERSON>Warren</PERSON>'s Blacking.  The hospital has certainly got a blow from which nothing but sound and allied management can recover it.  I met Dr <PERSON>Golding</PERSON> yesterday in <LOCATION>Hyde Park</LOCATION>.  He looked lonely and melancholy - had  on a "shocking bad hat" and was very ill drest.  Being near the Serpentine, I had serious fears he might be meditating self destruction, and watched him for some time, til he took the direction of the pond near <LOCATION>Kensington Palace</LOCATION>.  I sincerely trust his friends have heard of him.

Winchester</ORGANIZATION>, Aug 1, 1845
My dear <PERSON>Pettigrew</PERSON>,
I drop you a line to let you know how we are going on.  We are three at the <PERSON>White Hart</PERSON>, <PERSON>Waller</PERSON>, his friend <PERSON>Claxton</PERSON> (I think that is his name) and myself.  <PERSON>Waller</PERSON> and <PERSON>Claxton</PERSON> are drawing the paintings in the Cathedral.  The only ecclesiastic that I hear of as being here at present is Dr <PERSON>Dealty</PERSON> the senior prebend, who has power over the Cathedral, and who (<PERSON>Bradfield</PERSON> thinks) will come with us.  We have traced through the verger all sorts of people of the other side who have been at the Cathedral.  De Cauis??? (also in <PERSON>Parker</PERSON>'s draught) has been drawing the paintings, so that he will be forestalled by <PERSON>Waller</PERSON>.  
The mayor asks in a very friendly manner after you.  He appears to be perfectly zealous on our side, and the town as I understand it pretty generally with us.  <PERSON>Bradfield</PERSON> thinks that we shall have not less that fifty persons in the town and neighbourhood taking tickets.  The archives, which I looked at on Wednesday, are very poor, and they are shy of letting us look at them - but I shall get as much as I want, I have found by accident that Way has tricked the town clerk and I learn that Bruce/Buye has told them if I go in they must take care to have somebody to watch me - they are sadly afraid I shall set the town on fire.  I see the town clerk has been talked to - he is but a simple person, and I laughed him out of it.  I have selected some documents which he is to take to his office, and I am to go and work at them this morning.  
I was at <LOCATION>Southampton</LOCATION> yesterday, where I found people in a much higher degree of Civilization.  Everybody seemed to strive to excell the other in pleasing me.  The mayor had had a resolution passed in the town council the day before that I should do what I liked with their archives, and, he being obliged to go to <LOCATION>Brighton</LOCATION> when he is [...]for his wife's health, he left special orders to pay attention to me.  The town clerk also was ill, but he sent one of his clerks to stay with me all the day, and <PERSON>Allenby</PERSON> the banker invited me to dinner.  I am going again on Saturday.  The archives there are extremely valuable and very well kept.  I should not have been able to make a paper worth a fig of a report on these at <LOCATION>Winchester</LOCATION>, but the <LOCATION>Southampton</LOCATION> ones will set me up.  The worst is, I am forced to go over them very hastily.  I found that even at <LOCATION>Southampton</LOCATION> the enemy had been making at attempt to forestall me.  They had no influence with the authorities to hinder me.  But there was a gentleman who had belonged to the old corporation, who was pretty well acquainted with the records, and who came to give me any assistance he could in a very friendly manner.  In the middle of talking he said, "There is a friend of mine in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>, Mr <PERSON>Vaux</PERSON>, who has written to me to request I would give him any extracts I can from the <LOCATION>Southampton</LOCATION> records for a paper at the meeting at Winchester" I said, "of course you know that your friend Mr <PERSON>Vaux</PERSON> is on the other side".  He answered, "O yes, but I suppose you have all the same object and I will give any help I can to either."  They will not get much help out of him.  But what apes they are to try and imitate our papers, coming after us!  It shows they are taken hard up for subjects.  I hear that Way has applied to a farmer about 5 miles off who is said to have some barrows on his ground.  I have sent a joke on the subject to the Literary Gazette, but I don't know if <PERSON>Jerdan</PERSON> will put it in.
I see that we shall have as full access to the Cathedral and every other place here as we had at <LOCATION>Canterbury</LOCATION>, and I don't see the least harm or hindrance that can come from the dean and chapter being on the other side.  I look for <PERSON>Smith</PERSON>, <PERSON>Croker</PERSON>, and Fairholt today.  I unfortunately forgot to bring three of four tickets I had, but I suppose <PERSON>Smith</PERSON> will have plenty.  <PERSON>Halliwell</PERSON> will be here tomorrow.  The <ORGANIZATION>Winchester Chronicle</ORGANIZATION> of last Saturday has made a very curious blunder.  In one column they have inserted our advertisement, and in the another <PERSON>Parker</PERSON>'s advertisement of the Journal no. VI and of <PERSON>Willis</PERSON>' <ORGANIZATION>Canterbury Cathedral</ORGANIZATION>; but in the latter, where <PERSON>Parker</PERSON> had put an announcement of their meeting in September in large letters, the printer, I suppose thinking it was a mistake, has altered it to "this association will hold its second annual congress at <LOCATION>Winchester</LOCATION> in the week commencing August 4"!!  So that they have advertised our meeting!  I supposed a man may take a little boy instead of a lady with his ticket - I have stated so here, because one gentleman has his wife too ill to go, but would like to take his boy.  
I don't know if you will read my scribbling, for I am writing before breakfast, and very hungry
Yours every faithfully, 
<PERSON>Thomas Wright</PERSON>
