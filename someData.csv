I only received your favour of the 16th late last night, on my return from the Syro-Egyptian, or I would have answered before.  
I shall be very happy to meet Mr Wright at the Archaeological meeting this evening, the meeting of which society indeed, I have attended on the last occasion.  
Believe me, 
My dear sir, 
Yours very sincerely,

My dear Pettigrew,
On coming here, I have found your kind Note with its printed inclosure.  I thank you for both, but I should have been glad to have found you here in person.  I cannot call on you today, but I am desirous to assure you that I fully agree with our friend Mr Henry Ellis, that he & I ought not to mix ourselves up with either of the belligerent parties.  I am constitutionally a man of peace, and if I could assist in restoring that blessing, I would carry an olive branch to each of the Rival Camps, if I did not fear I should be drummed out of both.  I have great respect for Lord Albert Conyngham, and for many of your colleagues, as I also have for many of the staff on the other side.  I certainly shall not join them, but I am desirous that my name should be withdrawn from your committee, highly respectable, as it is, in its composition.  I sincerely hope that archaeological ??? will not interfere with the comforts of our antiquarian club, where I trust the word “archaeology” will not be even whispered.  “Oh no, we never mention it!”, shall at least be my motto there.
With the kindest regard, 
I remain always, 
My dear Pettigrew, 
Yours most sincerely, 
Thomas Amyot
T.J. Pettigrew Esq."
