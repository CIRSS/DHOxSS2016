I cannot call on you today, but I am desirous to assure you that I fully agree with our friend Mr <PERSON>Henry Ellis</PERSON>, that he & I ought not to mix ourselves up with either of the belligerent parties.  I am constitutionally a man of peace, and if I could assist in restoring that blessing, I would carry an olive branch to each of the <ORGANIZATION>Rival Camps</ORGANIZATION>, if I did not fear I should be drummed out of both.  I have great respect for <PERSON>Lord Albert Conyngham</PERSON>, and for many of your colleagues, as I also have for many of the staff on the other side.  I certainly shall not join them, but I am desirous that my name should be withdrawn from your committee, highly respectable, as it is, in its composition.  I sincerely hope that archaeological ??? will not interfere with the comforts of our antiquarian club, where I trust the word �archaeology� will not be even whispered.  �Oh no, we never mention it!�, shall at least be my motto there.
With the kindest regard,

I shall not be able to prepare a Reading, nor probably be able to be in <LOCATION>Canterbury</LOCATION> more than one day, or two days at most.  Since there are others, Mr <PERSON>James</PERSON> for instance, who would better fill up the printer�s blank with literary & historical name.  My [�] at <ORGANIZATION>Somerset House</ORGANIZATION> alone gives one anything like a pretence for accepting the elevation you propose.

My Dear Pettigrew
I have had a severe and unremitting diarrhea upon me ever since I returned, which commenced at <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> and remained until yesterday, which has greatly reduced me and rendered me very weak, and I much fear will prevent my being at <LOCATION>Gloucester</LOCATION> on <DATE>Monday</DATE> as I most anxiously wished to be.  My <ORGANIZATION>Medicus</ORGANIZATION> says I ought not to attempt it,  but if I get [�] I shall not be influenced much by that, as I think I can judge of my own capabilities better than any one, and if I feel myself equal to the undertaking you will see me as sure as the <ORGANIZATION>Angel of Darkness</ORGANIZATION> looks over <LOCATION>Lincoln</LOCATION>.  What this saying means is a good subject for an Archaeological Paper � does it infer that he takes no notice of that famous city?  That he overlooks it?  That he oversees with particular care?  That he hovers over it?  That he does not look into it?  Many other questions of the same order and category may be propounded, which able antiquaries may discuss if not puzzle themselves and the world with.  For my part I think his majesty looks into most large cities and smiles with ineffable delight on what he sees in them.  There can be no doubt but he was delighted at <LOCATION>Gloucester</LOCATION> when the glorious Protestant martyrs were burned there and will probably be present next week to say something in favour of medieval or primeval antiquities.  He is now at <LOCATION>York</LOCATION> but the <ORGANIZATION>Rail Roads</ORGANIZATION> will transport him with delight in a very short period of time if he require such assistance.  No doubt he prevented Mr Way from attending at <LOCATION>York</LOCATION> and was devilish glad to accomplish so great an object.  The ominous absence of the Secretary of the <ORGANIZATION>Institute</ORGANIZATION> suggests the idea of a new split, is he contriving a new society?  What will he call it?  I do not know?  Can you say?  This is a letter of queries but the worst for me is query if I shall not be prevented from attending?  I hope not.  Ever truly yours,

As the <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> is not held until my season of lecture expires I had made up my mind to deny myself the pleasure of being amongst you.

My book on the Roman Wall is at present absorbing all my attention, but having before I turned to this subject investigated with some care the structure of the <ORGANIZATION>Norman Castle</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>England</LOCATION> I could without much difficulty be prepared with a popular lecture on that subject.

I have been from home examining two of the secondary stations of the Wall which are least accessible and which I had not visited before.  My Manchester paper was very hastily written (owing to the pressure of my engagements) and of course never intended for publication.

My dear Sir, 
I copy <PERSON>Mr Smith</PERSON>�s letter which coupled with a leading article in the time-serving Times, you will at once perceive neither in tone nor temper is likely to advance the interests of the <ORGANIZATION>British Archaeological Society</ORGANIZATION>.  I have written to Mr Way my sentiments upon this matter, fully � especially, as I think I proposed Mr <PERSON>Sidney Herbert</PERSON> and Captain <PERSON>Brandreth</PERSON> as members of the association.  Pray let us discuss this <PERSON>Humphrey</PERSON> barrow question fully on <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>, and then we shall establish a barometer by which the new society can be understood.  Forgive this pun, it is not mine, but Hook�s and does not refer to <LOCATION>Greenwich Park</LOCATION> but to Sir <PERSON>John Barrow</PERSON> and the Quarterly Review.

�I have submitted your communication to me to the <ORGANIZATION>Central Committee of the B.A.A</ORGANIZATION>.

Today I have letters from Sir <PERSON>Thomas Deane</PERSON>, and from Sir <PERSON>William Chatterton</PERSON> desiring their names to be added to the list of subscribers for the <ORGANIZATION>Winchester Vol</ORGANIZATION>. which I will thank you to do.  
Chatterton says � �One word to acknowledge the receipt of the Circular from the �Real, original <ORGANIZATION>Archaeological Association� N.B.</ORGANIZATION> no connection with any other house.  As I suppose this comes from your worship I announce to you that I am quite ready to take a copy provided you do not insist upon my reading the 600 pages!�

Your note takes me, after what I forwarded to you, quite by surprise: because from the letter I received I had formed a notion that Mr. <PERSON>Gilbert</PERSON> did not intend to resign the Presidency voluntarily: and you say �he has sent me his resignation in favor of the <ORGANIZATION>Duke of Sussex</ORGANIZATION> and H.R.H. has accepted of the nomination�
I dine with Bland tomorrow at six, and will call on you in <LOCATION>Saville Row</LOCATION> at Four or a little earlier.  
I am ruralising for Vacation here in the midst of sloppy ways � not here voluntarily � but, like thousands more, have a house which I wish to let, and feel it might be kept aired at least a little till I find a tenant for it.
I conclude Mr <PERSON>Gilbert</PERSON> will not be desirous of going back to the <ORGANIZATION>Treasurership</ORGANIZATION>.  But of this and all other matters when we meet tomorrow.

Sir
I cannot resist the desire I feel to write at once & thank you for the lucid and able manner in which you explained the fallacies of Mr <PERSON>Bruce</PERSON> <TIME>last night</TIME> at the Antiquaries; and for the manly attempt you made to save the Society�s respectability, and prevent an act of mad suicide.  I am so sure that you took the strictly proper view of the question, that I feel bound to thank you for the trouble and exertion you voluntarily underwent and I am sure the Society is much indebted to you in thus doing your best to save that position, which they have now forever lost.  
I feel so strongly on this point that I cannot trust myself to say all that I feel on Mr <PERSON>Bruce</PERSON>�s pamphlet, it is utterly illogical and inconclusive.  I could attach little value to a simple question, which requires 47 octavo pages to expound, it looks too much like special pleading, while his preface repudiates any claims �morally or justly� [�]

Dear Pettigrew,
I have waited hitherto in the anxious expectation of getting for you a <ORGANIZATION>Hereford Times</ORGANIZATION> paper, in which my inaugural address appeared.  But no premium on the original cost can procure one, as the whole impression (though enlarged on the occasion) was swept away at once.  King of the <ORGANIZATION>Herald�s College</ORGANIZATION> has a copy that he would shew you, if you can contrive it, but the honor you intend me is not worth putting you to trouble to perform, though I am quite sensible of my obligation.  
The first lecture on the Histy. of <LOCATION>England</LOCATION> was to have appeared to day, but instead there is a postponement of a first portion to next <DATE>Saturday</DATE>.  If they send me from Hereford the number I have ordered, I shall have the pleasure of forwarding one to you.  But please read it as address to mechanics who have all to learn.
King will bring down the sword on the 5th of <DATE>August</DATE>, and what you sent with it I am expecting with a large package of books by the waggon.  
I trust your daughter was quite well when you heard from her and that if she and her husband ever feel inclined to travel towards this part of the world I shall be most happy to receive then as <ORGANIZATION>Goodrich Court</ORGANIZATION>.

Dear Pettigrew
I am very greatly obliged by the trouble you have been taking about the catalogues, and trust sooner or later your exertions will be crowned with success.  I fear your kindness induces you to speak too well of what I addressed to the mechanics, but it must always be borne in mind, that I had to speak to people but little informed.  This post ought to have conveyed to you a portion of my 2nd lecture but the editor of the <ORGANIZATION>Hereford Times</ORGANIZATION> has not sent me the right number.  I have however written to him, and as soon as I get it, will forward your copy.  Many thanks for your kind intention respecting the Medical Superstitions.  The book cannot fail to be interesting, if as well compsosed as your other works.  
I regret to hear of Mr <PERSON>Gurney</PERSON>�s bad state of health, but as I know he is in good hands, am sure that all which science and skill can effect, he will have the good fortune to experience.  
Not unnecessarily to intrude, I shall beg to be remembered to the different branches of your family when you write to them, and to subscribe myself
Most truly yours

My dear Pettigrew
The only reason I did not transmit to you my approval of your reply was an idea that it would be surplusage, as every unprejudiced person must have regarded it as quite satisfactory.  I am delighted with the sentence p.g. beginning �It may be safe,� but what most astonishes me is your praiseworthy conduct in being so temperate while so much is done to stimulate your anger.
I cannot be present at <ORGANIZATION>Winchester</ORGANIZATION>.  If I could for one day, I would for all.  The lecture on shipbuilding thought calculated for a <ORGANIZATION>Mechanics Institute</ORGANIZATION> would requite not only to be greatly simplified, but treated more scientifically when read to so learned a body as the <ORGANIZATION>British Archaeological Society</ORGANIZATION>.  For this I have not the time.  The Hon. G. Secretary of the <ORGANIZATION>Archaeological Society</ORGANIZATION> asked me last year to dress up the paper I sent to the Antiquaries, on alphabetical notation in music, for your last meeting at <ORGANIZATION>Canterbury</ORGANIZATION>.  
Had the <ORGANIZATION>Dean of Hereford</ORGANIZATION> kept his promise (a practice I never find him pursue) and given me tracings from a flyleaf to a book in the Cathedral library, I think with other memoranda, a curious dissertation might be written on that subject, but for all the renewed promises on this matter I have waited in vain.  
Wishing you every success, and still hoping that the severed parts of <ORGANIZATION>the Association</ORGANIZATION> may be reunited, 
I remain, my dear friend,

I shall also send you <ORGANIZATION>Shaw</ORGANIZATION>�s tracing & King�s colouring of the painted slab you wished with a pencil tracing of the figure by the note to shew with how much more spirit and how far more artistically the original is.  There will be with it the ground plans and elevations of the ship temples, to which your artist must give effect and which must be numbered with corresponding references in the letter-press.

My object in speaking to Mr <PERSON>Wright</PERSON> was to know whether my paper on the Llanvair rail which I had written to demonstrate its being alphabetic musical notation, was to be published in the account of the <ORGANIZATION>Gloucester Congress</ORGANIZATION>.  He said that he could not answer the question till there had been a meeting to determine the matter and that he would speak to you o the subject.  You will very greatly oblige me by the earliest information thereon, as should it be rejected, I must beg to have the paper and drawings returned as soon after as possible, because I should then read it at the congress of the <ORGANIZATION>Cambrian Archaeological Institute</ORGANIZATION> at Aberystwyth in the second week in <DATE>September</DATE>.  I would much rather both my communications appeared with your Association, but if that be inconvenient, I must send an early notice to the Cambrian secretary.

Dear Sir,
I shall only say in answer to what you observe on the invention of my name, that you will see from the enclosed my wish that it shod remains set down for five copies.  On the subject of <PERSON>Walter Scott</PERSON> I think that he has considerable genius too much alloyed by taste; but I have never seen either genius or taste in the criticisms on poetry I have read in the <LOCATION>Edinburgh</LOCATION> Review; which seems quite at variance with <LOCATION>Longinus</LOCATION> on the pleasure derived from antientry (?).  They seem to wish the distinction of received opinions on poetry, without substituting new ones, or even explaining what they would have.  I congratulate you on the idea of <ORGANIZATION>Westminster Abbey</ORGANIZATION> as a subject of local poetry, & wonder I never thought of it, in reading Spectator, or <ORGANIZATION>Walker�s St James</ORGANIZATION>�s Park.  It is one indeed replete with sublimity; of which your plan, too, allows the full operation.  I did not think I should have had to quote in answer to you, as West did in answer to Gray �vive paulisper cum vivis� for I have lately upbraided a really old bard, <PERSON>Jerningham</PERSON>, for writing his Farewell, when he presented it to me.  I hope you will be the poet, if there is to be one, who will celebrate Stoke; as Dr <PERSON>Lyther</PERSON> who was meditating it, is dead, & cannot therefore prevent it from sharing his fate.  In the mean time, I trust we shall drink to the memory of <ORGANIZATION>Horace & Maecenas</ORGANIZATION>, writers of the old school, when their busts adorn my garden, opposite to each other, & breathe a wish for the restoration of pure taste, on perusing the immortal alcaics beneath them.

The inquiries here instituted as to the origin of the cognate coinages of this and the neighbouring country may tend to direct our views as to the proper principles on which our ancient British coinage is to be considered and enable somewhat more definite views to be entertained on the rather obscure point of the period of its commencement and other particulars of interest.
Six wood cuts of coins and one plate will be required, the former will be from about 36s to two pounds as near as I can judge  The plate I will have engraved at my own expense.  The paper will occupy 14 or 15 pages of the Journal

My dear Sir, 
At the last meeting of our sub-committee, I announced that the landlord of the apartments of the <ORGANIZATION>Num</ORGANIZATION>. Soc. objected to our meeting in them.  Mr Way requested me to wait until <DATE>Monday</DATE> before I took steps to inform the <ORGANIZATION>Committee</ORGANIZATION> of this unlooked-for obstruction as he thought he could obtain for us leave to meet in the room of the Society of Literature; but I have not yet heard from him.  We also spoke of your kindness in offering us the use of one of your rooms.  I am however up to the present moment uninformed of Mr Way�s views, and shall be obliged by your giving me your opinion in this emergency that I may have time to send letters to the various members of the <ORGANIZATION>Committee</ORGANIZATION>.
I am,

My dear Pettigrew,
On coming home pretty <TIME>late last evening</TIME>, I found your two goodly-looking & pretty tomes on my table, & I merely start this off to announce their safe arrival, and express my hearty thanks for the same.  I have been devouring them all day, & can fancy that the shade of <PERSON>Harris Nicholas</PERSON> must look blue.  He ought to have given both his ears for a snatch of the letters you got hold of.
Have you seen <PERSON>Roach Smith</PERSON> again since I saw you?  He seems very much in <LOCATION>earnest</LOCATION> about making an amalgamation of parties,  - but after what you said, I fear the moment has not yet arrived for such a consummation.

My dear Sir
In consequence of your intimation that I might give the ticket you were so good as to forward me to a friend in spite of the �not transferable� on its face, I have sent it to the Revd. Geo. <PERSON>Wallace</PERSON>, headmaster of the <ORGANIZATION>King�s School</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Canterbury</ORGANIZATION>.  I have been unequal to my previous exertions ever since my last visit to <LOCATION>East Kent</LOCATION>, on my way thither, at Mr <PERSON>Darrell</PERSON>�s at <LOCATION>Calehill</LOCATION>, I had a violent attack of <LOCATION>Cholera</LOCATION>, and was forced to spare myself when under other hospitable roofs.  I continued to exert myself, however until on <DATE>9th June 1843</DATE>, when I had a paralytic stroke, & since when, good spirits are almost the only sign of my former self remaining.  Whilst I live, however, I shall take an interest in antiquarian researches, and be happy if my stores can be made useful to others.  They are ample, in the medieval period of our <ORGANIZATION>County History</ORGANIZATION>.  
My friend <PERSON>Lambert Larking</PERSON> will probably be pleased with an opportunity of referring to a letter, in the Chapter Library, from a vicar written to a Prior of Xtr <ORGANIZATION>Chh</ORGANIZATION>. of which I made an imperfect copy, upon which we tried our skill together.
He has himself no common skill in decyphering old writing, but if a fee will obtain more competent assistance, beg him to advance it on my account.  I presume the association have secured access to the Chapter Library.  It was kindly accorded to myself by <ORGANIZATION>Dr Spry</ORGANIZATION>.
On the <ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION> side of the cloisters is a figure, commonly pointed out as Prior Chillenden.  There is a legend round it, of which sufficient remains legible to show it to be �<PERSON>Frater John �Schepuys</PERSON>(?)�.  
On the south side of the cloisters, the tale of the fox (or wolf) and the geese, is given on a succession of bosses, on the last of which, the cloister has vented its satire and I think it is worth observing, though it might escape if you were not awake to it.
I had occasion to fall so foul of <PERSON>Mr Willement</PERSON>, that several of my friends have expressed their regret, but I must call attention to other instances of his misrepresentation, that I have not already brought forward, that will justify me.  His No. 737, which he calls a lyon salient on a throne, will be seen to be a lyon breaking out of a cage; and his Number 242, & 259, to be very incorrectly blazoned.  But my pen and my hand fail me, and it is well, as few attach the importance to heraldry that I do.  
Respectfully,
Though with a weary hand, 
Thos. Steatfield

You will be quite welcome to the use of the engraving of the Jewry Wall.  The plan was lithographed for me in this town from a draught prepared by Mr <ORGANIZATION>Wickes</ORGANIZATION>.  I believe the stone has been altered since my copies were taken from it: therefore, if you require other for the journal, the plan will require lithographing afresh.

In such a case as <PERSON>Mr Isaacson</PERSON>, [my Co] my editorial duties must be merely to see the MS through the press: I may not add, nor take away.  What I should propose is, that each author condense his own paper: for it is an awkward matter to shorten the noses of other people�s children.  The 3 papers you have confided to me number 50 sides of MS: the quantity of type that will occupy depends upon the style of writing: I should say about 40 pages: if so, they are scarcely more than may fairly be set up verbatim.  
All prosperities to you & yours.  If ever you want to see me about the Volume, or anything else, I will if you send me times, call on you when in your morning gown.  Our kind regards to <PERSON>Mrs Pettigrew</PERSON> & you ??? & I am,

Dear Sir,
I received your note yesterday, and in reply beg to send a printed copy of the little essay on the kind of which you make such use as may be convenient.  It purports to have been printed along with the Met. Literary Journal, but such was not the case on account of a delay at the printers and there are not ten copies of it circulating � these being among friends in the <LOCATION>North of England</LOCATION>.  I am not surprised at the difficulty in establishing a Medical Journal, and it was from a knowledge of such difficulty that I ventured to propose the propriety of the medical profession in the various provincial towns being canvassed in the way of business, so that a valuable property might in a few weeks be made of it, when as under other circumstances, it too often happens that great costs are incurred.  I have not seen the work advertised � if you wish it & will send it, I think I could take upon my to say that I would have the prospectus in the Conser. Journal, at one third the price.  We circulate several thousands.  
I am sorry to say I have not by me the cowardly and abject apology of the Rev. <PERSON>Mr Worthington</PERSON>.  I do not know that there one person living whom I more thoroughly despise than this man.  I consider him a mean and dastardly calumniator, and totally worthless as an individual.  His public conduct is everywhere offensive, and I noticed him figuring very discreditably the other day at the <ORGANIZATION>Mansion House</ORGANIZATION>, when he was called to order by the <ORGANIZATION>Lord Mayor</ORGANIZATION>.  His officiousness in joining the <ORGANIZATION>Committee</ORGANIZATION> of a public newspaper is extremely reprehensible, and I am not sure that both his conduct and that of another clergyman on the same committee ought not to be laid before the Bishop of the <LOCATION>Diocese</LOCATION>.  I have read the joint stock reply, which the Charing Cross people have made to your charges.  It is really as a composition below contempt, and I find that the refutations are chiefly supported by one another.  The testimonials of Dr this & Dr that is really too absurd � and only worthy of the invention of Patent Medicines, <PERSON>Rowlands� Macassar</PERSON>, or Warren�s Blacking.  The hospital has certainly got a blow from which nothing but sound and allied management can recover it.  I met Dr <PERSON>Golding</PERSON> yesterday in <LOCATION>Hyde Park</LOCATION>.  He looked lonely and melancholy � had  on a �shocking bad hat� and was very ill drest.  Being near the Serpentine, I had serious fears he might be meditating self destruction, and watched him for some time, til he took the direction of the pond near <LOCATION>Kensington Palace</LOCATION>.  I sincerely trust his friends have heard of him.

Winchester</ORGANIZATION>, Aug 1, 1845
My dear Pettigrew,
I drop you a line to let you know how we are going on.  We are three at the <PERSON>White Hart</PERSON>, <PERSON>Waller</PERSON>, his friend <PERSON>Claxton</PERSON> (I think that is his name) and myself.  Waller and <PERSON>Claxton</PERSON> are drawing the paintings in the <LOCATION>Cathedral</LOCATION>.  The only ecclesiastic that I hear of as being here at present is Dr Dealty the senior prebend, who has power over the Cathedral, and who (<ORGANIZATION>Bradfield</ORGANIZATION> thinks) will come with us.  We have traced through the verger all sorts of people of the other side who have been at the <ORGANIZATION>Cathedral</ORGANIZATION>.  De Cauis??? (also in <LOCATION>Parker</LOCATION>�s draught) has been drawing the paintings, so that he will be forestalled by <PERSON>Waller</PERSON>.  
The mayor asks in a very friendly manner after you.  He appears to be perfectly zealous on our side, and the town as I understand it pretty generally with us.  Bradfield thinks that we shall have not less that fifty persons in the town and neighbourhood taking tickets.  The archives, which I looked at on <DATE>Wednesday</DATE>, are very poor, and they are shy of letting us look at them � but I shall get as much as I want, I have found by accident that Way has tricked the town clerk and I learn that Bruce/Buye has told them if I go in they must take care to have somebody to watch me � they are sadly afraid I shall set the town on fire.  I see the town clerk has been talked to � he is but a simple person, and I laughed him out of it.  I have selected some documents which he is to take to his office, and I am to go and work at them <TIME>this morning</TIME>.  
I was at <LOCATION>Southampton</LOCATION> yesterday, where I found people in a much higher degree of Civilization.  Everybody seemed to strive to <ORGANIZATION>excell</ORGANIZATION> the other in pleasing me.  The mayor had had a resolution passed in the town council the day before that I should do what I liked with their archives, and, he being obliged to go to <LOCATION>Brighton</LOCATION> when he is [�]for his wife�s health, he left special orders to pay attention to me.  The town clerk also was ill, but he sent one of his clerks to stay with me all the day, and <PERSON>Allenby</PERSON> the banker invited me to dinner.  I am going again on <DATE>Saturday</DATE>.  The archives there are extremely valuable and very well kept.  I should not have been able to make a paper worth a fig of a report on these at <ORGANIZATION>Winchester</ORGANIZATION>, but the <ORGANIZATION>Southampton</ORGANIZATION> ones will set me up.  The worst is, I am forced to go over them very hastily.  I found that even at Southampton the enemy had been making at attempt to forestall me.  They had no influence with the authorities to hinder me.  But there was a gentleman who had belonged to the old corporation, who was pretty well acquainted with the records, and who came to give me any assistance he could in a very friendly manner.  In the middle of talking he said, �There is a friend of mine in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Mr Vaux</PERSON>, who has written to me to request I would give him any extracts I can from the <LOCATION>Southampton</LOCATION> records for a paper at the meeting at Winchester� I said, �of course you know that your friend Mr <PERSON>Vaux</PERSON> is on the other side�.  He answered, �O yes, but I suppose you have all the same object and I will give any help I can to either.�  They will not get much help out of him.  But what apes they are to try and imitate our papers, coming after us!  It shows they are taken hard up for subjects.  I hear that Way has applied to a farmer about 5 miles off who is said to have some barrows on his ground.  I have sent a joke on the subject to the Literary Gazette, but I don�t know if <PERSON>Jerdan</PERSON> will put it in.
I see that we shall have as full access to the Cathedral and every other place here as we had at <LOCATION>Canterbury</LOCATION>, and I don�t see the least harm or hindrance that can come from the dean and chapter being on the other side.  I look for <ORGANIZATION>Smith</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Croker</PERSON>, and Fairholt today.  I unfortunately forgot to bring three of four tickets I had, but I suppose <PERSON>Smith</PERSON> will have plenty.  <PERSON>Halliwell</PERSON> will be here tomorrow.  The <ORGANIZATION>Winchester Chronicle of</ORGANIZATION> <DATE>last Saturday</DATE> has made a very curious blunder.  In one column they have inserted our advertisement, and in the another <PERSON>Parker</PERSON>�s advertisement of the Journal no. VI and of <ORGANIZATION>Willis� Canterbury Cathedral</ORGANIZATION>; but in the latter, where <PERSON>Parker</PERSON> had put an announcement of their meeting in <DATE>September</DATE> in large letters, the printer, I suppose thinking it was a mistake, has altered it to �this association will hold its second annual congress at Winchester in the week commencing <DATE>August 4</DATE>�!!  So that they have advertised our meeting!  I supposed a man may take a little boy instead of a lady with his ticket � I have stated so here, because one gentleman has his wife too ill to go, but would like to take his boy.

I had the impression that there was none this week, till I received a note from <PERSON>Smith</PERSON> about an hour ago, in which he said he was starting to the meetg. of council.  Had I known before, I would have come.  
I had like to have come to disturb you <TIME>last night</TIME>; though I don�t know if you would have liked it had it been late.  Mr <PERSON>Guizot</PERSON>�s mother was taken unwell yesterday � she is very old, and the trouble of the late events, with change of climate, &c have had their effect upon her.  Mr <PERSON>Guizot</PERSON> sent to me <TIME>last night</TIME> that Dr <PERSON>Holland</PERSON> had visited her in the <TIME>morning</TIME>, but that he wished much to know if there were anybody [�] to call in immediately if she were ill in the <TIME>night</TIME>.  I got him the name of a person here but I told him I believed my friend <PERSON>Mr Pettigrew</PERSON> to be one of the most distinguished in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>, and if he would call me up, I thought I could fetch you in little more than half an hour.  I don�t know whether I was doing right or not � but today <ORGANIZATION>Madame Guizot</ORGANIZATION> is better.  I have not a notion where Dr <PERSON>Holland</PERSON> lives.  
Ever yours, 
<PERSON>Thomas Wright</PERSON>

My dear sir,
I like your articles very much, and should be much obliged by your continuing them.  I have a list given me, when I took the work, by <PERSON>Mr Ron</PERSON>, containing a few lines all through the alphabet which he had accepted of another gentleman � I think it only contains 3 or 4 names in B, and there is none before <ORGANIZATION>Bell</ORGANIZATION>.  You will always, if you please, omit the ancient (I mean roman & greek) and oriental physicians, &c� I should be glad to have up to BAR, in a day or two, if convenient.  
No. VIII will be ready this week, with a brief preface to vol. 2.  I think this no. VIII is the best which has yet appeared, I hope you will approve of it.  I think the dictionary is informing.  
You will be glad to see we have completed our list of vice-presidents to the <ORGANIZATION>Historical Society of Science</ORGANIZATION>, with so good a name as <PERSON>Lord Holland</PERSON>�s.
I am, my dear sir,
Very sincerely yours, 
<PERSON>Thomas Wright</PERSON>.

My dear sir, 
If you have an opportunity of saying a word to any members of the new council of the <ORGANIZATION>Royal Society</ORGANIZATION> to <PERSON>Mr Haas</PERSON>, whom I mentioned to you yesterday, I shall be very much obliged indeed.  He has called on me to say that he hears the appointment will probably be settled on <DATE>Thursday</DATE> next, and he is very anxious about it.  He only seeks the minor place of librarian, and I think has a very good chance. 
I have read through your volume on Medical Superstitions with which I am much pleased and interested.  I should think it would be very successful.  You have brought together much very curious matter.  
I am, my dear sir, 
Very faithfully yours, 
<PERSON>Thomas Wright</PERSON>

My dear sir
I see nothing suspicious about the cat � I have sent you the stomach & [�] that you may judge for yourself.
I, however, should take the safest course, for I have one instance even present in my mind when the examination of the quadruped presented nothing to cause alarm, yet hydrophobia followed � I am, my dear sir, 
Very faithfully yours, 
<PERSON>W. Youatt</PERSON>
The circumstances under which I have since learned that the bite was inflicted are suspicious.
